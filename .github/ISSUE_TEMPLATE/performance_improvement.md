## Current Behavior
Describe the current performance characteristic (timing, resource usage).

## Proposed Optimization
What to change and why it helps.

## Impact Estimate
- Expected time savings (seconds / %)
- Affected scan tiers (Quick / Standard / Deep)

## Technical Approach
- Modules/files touched:
- Functions to modify:
- Risks / edge cases:

## Benchmarks (If Available)
Before:
```
(attach timing logs)
```
After (planned/actual):
```
```

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] New timing added to log
- [ ] No functional regression
- [ ] Works without admin rights

## Additional Notes
Links, references, prior related issues.
